# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep QuickDrop and its users safe.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or pull requests.

Instead, use one of these:
1) **GitHub Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred)
2) If you can’t use advisories, contact the maintainer privately - raikov0411@gmail.com

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected version(s)
- Any relevant logs/config (remove secrets)

## Supported versions
Security fixes are provided for:
- The latest released version
- Potentially the latest `master` if the fix is not easily backportable

## Coordinated disclosure
Please give a reasonable time window to investigate and ship a fix before disclosing publicly.

## Response targets (best effort)
- Initial response: within 7 days
- Status update: within 14 days
